# IMPORTANT!
# Optional node properties (those with default values commonly used,)
# can be left from the saved project files, optimizing them for size.
# This is a tricky process and may depend on the version of Arrow, runtime and project file format.
# It's advised to be used on versions with universally trusted defaults (i.e. most of recent stable releases.)
const SAVE_UNOPTIMIZED = false

# NOTE: All `Content` parameters are optional with following defaults:
const DEFAULT_NODE_DATA = {
	"title": "",
	"content": "",
	"brief": 0,
	"auto": false,
	"clear": false,
}
