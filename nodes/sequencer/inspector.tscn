Although sequencers play their connected nodes in slots order,
depending on playing nodes and runtime implementations,
they may run queued or in parallel with no guarantee.
Branches could run in exponentially unexpected order.

It may cause many different unintended behaviors, such as
variable checks and updates in wrong order,
displaying multiple nodes waiting for user action,
printing contents in surprising ways,
etc.

Note!
Skipped sequencers only run their last connected slot."
